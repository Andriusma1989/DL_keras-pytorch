# Breast Cancer Prediction using PyTorch and Keras
This repository contains a breast cancer prediction model implemented using PyTorch and Keras. The dataset used is from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The project's primary aim is to compare the performance of deep learning models created with PyTorch and Keras.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features each. The target variable is the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).

## Results
The test accuracy of the PyTorch and Keras models are:

PyTorch: 0.9912
Keras: 0.9912

Both models demonstrate a high accuracy in predicting breast cancer diagnosis. While both PyTorch and Keras achieve similar performance in this project, Keras is generally easier to use, due to its simplicity and high-level abstractions. PyTorch, on the other hand, offers more flexibility and control for advanced users who need to build complex models or dive deep into the framework's internals.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have a Google account to access the Colab platform. Once you have access, you can open the DL_HW.ipynb notebook file in Colab and execute the code cells.
