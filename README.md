# Breast Cancer Prediction using PyTorch and Keras
This repository contains a breast cancer prediction model implemented using PyTorch and Keras. The dataset used is from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The project's primary aim is to compare the performance of deep learning models created with PyTorch and Keras.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features each. The target variable is the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).

## Results
The test accuracy of the PyTorch and Keras models are:

PyTorch: 0.9912
Keras: 0.9912
Both models demonstrate a high accuracy in predicting breast cancer diagnosis.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have a Google account to access the Colab platform. Once you have access, you can open the picture_slicing.ipynb notebook file in Colab and execute the code cells.
